# Data Modeling 
* Is the process of defining and analyzing data requirements needed to support the business processes within the scope of an organization’s IT systems landscape. 
    * These data requirements are specified in graphical models we refer to as data models.

## data modeling typically results in 3 deliverables:
### Conceputal Data Model
* The Conceptual Data Model is centered in the business domain. 
* No tech-talk. 
* Conversation isn’t about data; it’s about information. 
* What real life concepts are we aiming to model? 
They need to be identified and defined, along with basic information on how they relate.


###  Logical Data Model
* More detailed talk about entities. 
* Determine what attributes need to be on each entity to adequately represent the information concepts. 
* Explicitly define the relationships (one-to-many, one-to-one, etc.) between these entities. 



###  Physical Data Model
* Provides clear instructions on how to implement the logical model with a specific technology: a PostgreSQL database, for example. 
* Communicate implementation-specific details that the data engineers require to begin their work.

Data modeling job, is to draft a clear and concise model for each of these three layers.
